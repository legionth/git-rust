# git-rust

This project is just for me while I'm learning the
Rust programming language.

Some code parts may seem odd, but that is just
because I'm not super familiar with the language
yet.

If you interested in participating feel free to
add some Pull Requests here.


__Don't wonder that the PRs here are incomplete or not entirely functioning or covered by tests. I'm learning in my limited free time. So be please be kind :)__
